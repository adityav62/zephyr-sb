# Overview
The work presented in this repository was carried out at the Chair of Real-Time Systems @ RPTU Kaiserslautern during my time there as a HiWi.

Zephyr was first evaluated through a series of small, exploratory applications, and once its suitability was confirmed, the work culminated in the development of a self‑balancing robot.

Alongside the software evaluation, a modular architecture was designed for the robot. This included a full schematic and a set of interchangeable sensor modules that can be attached to the self‑balancing chassis for experimentation and extension.

The repository also includes several additional applications that, while not directly part of the main project, were developed as exploratory experiments for potential future work, along with a few self‑learning projects.
